# UI/UX Sub-Project - Claude Context

## Project Overview
Deep dive investigation and design of the Idea Foundry user interface and user experience. This sub-project explores the visual design, interaction patterns, usability, and delight factors that make search and knowledge management feel intuitive, beautiful, and powerful.

## Goals
1. **Understand** current UI/UX architecture and component design
2. **Evaluate** existing interaction patterns and their effectiveness
3. **Design** optimal UX for search, navigation, and knowledge discovery
4. **Implement** improvements that enhance usability and delight
5. **Document** design decisions, patterns, and rationale

## Key Context
- **User Base**: Single user (personal knowledge management)
- **Constraints**: None on complexity or innovation - prioritize elegance and delight
- **Infrastructure**: React/TypeScript frontend, Supabase backend
- **Goal**: Create a beautiful, intuitive interface that makes knowledge work feel effortless
